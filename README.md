# CSS Image Mask

Masks share a lot in common with backgrounds in that you can size them, position them, and repeat them and such just like backgrounds. See the related properties below. But hereâ€™s another interesting thing about masks that they share with backgrounds: they can be gradients.

The mask-image property can also be used directly inside SVG elements too.

## Usage

```css
mask-image: url(mask-image.png); 
-webkit-mask-image: url(mask-image.png);  
mask-repeat: no-repeat;
-webkit-mask-repeat: no-repeat;
mask-size: 100%;
-webkit-mask-size: 100% ;    
```
